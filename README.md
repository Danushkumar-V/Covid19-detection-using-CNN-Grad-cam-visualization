# Covid19-detection-using-CNN-Grad-cam-visualization
The "Covid-19 detection using CNN and Grad-CAM visualization" project is a deep learning project that involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to detect Covid-19 from X-ray images.

In this project, the goal would be to build a CNN model that can analyze X-ray images of the lungs and determine whether or not the person depicted in the image has Covid-19. The model would be trained on a dataset of X-ray images of both Covid-positive and Covid-negative individuals.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict whether a new X-ray image represents a person with Covid-19 or not. The model's predictions can be further analyzed using Grad-CAM visualization, which allows users to see which parts of the X-ray image the model is most focused on when making its predictions.

This project could have a variety of applications, such as helping healthcare professionals to quickly and accurately diagnose Covid-19, or enabling the development of automated systems for screening and detecting the disease in large populations.
